//This text file say about the improvements done in the grammar to make the failed sentences work as per the modified grammar.

2. Look at the grammar. What changes to the grammar alone could improve the parsing (in particular, consider coordinated conjunctions)? Modify the grammar somewhat and evaluate the improvements. What new sentences may be parsed? What invalid sentences are now parsed (if any)?

1) yet john steals

-This sentence includes the co-ordinated conjunction "yet" which were not abled to parse before but can be parsed now by adding the follwoing grammar rules in the simple.gr and new file crated is imporvements_grammar.gr.
			Rules added: s->sbar np
				     np->fname fv
		              	     fv-> steals
				     sbar->yet

2) i live for watermelons
-Added sbar which tends to co-ordinated conjunctions.
-This sentence a can now be parsed after adding rules in the grammar such as:
			   Rules added: vbar-mods->sbar fn
	      			     	sbar->	for
	       				sbar->	and
	       				sbar->	nor
	       				sbar->	but
	       				sbar->	or
	       				sbar->	so
	       				sbar->	yet
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
